# S3DynamodbVideoplayer
A simple website for users to upload and watch videos. I created this project as part of a college exercise in order to expand my full-stack development abilities and get myself used to the Amazon Web Services platform, more specifically how to utilize AWS's DynamoDB and S3 services. **As a requirement for this project, user data had to be stored in mySQL and video-related information on DynamoDB, so that's why two databases were used regardless of its small scale.**

# Features
